# Kidney Disease Detection App - Docker + Render Deployment

This repository contains a Streamlit web application to detect signs of **Kidney Disease** using a deep learning model built with **TensorFlow (VGG16 transfer learning)**.

---

## 🔍 App Features

* Upload a kidney CT scan image (JPG/PNG)
* The model predicts:

  * ✅ No Kidney Disease
  * 🚨 Likely Kidney Disease
* Designed as a **supportive AI assistant** for medical professionals — **not a replacement for diagnosis**.

## 🚀 Deploying to Render using Docker Hub

1. **Build and Push Docker Image to Docker Hub**

   ```bash
   docker build -t pavi2803/kidney-disease-app:latest .
   docker push pavi2803/kidney-disease-app:latest
   ```

2. **Set Up Render Web Service**

   * Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)
   * Click **New Web Service** > **Existing Image**
   * Enter:

     * **Image URL**: `docker.io/pavi2803/kidney-disease-app:latest`
     * **Port**: `8080`
     * **Start Command**: leave blank (Docker CMD handles this)
   * Click **Connect**
